However, just the sight of the balance beam made me cry. After trying both gymnastics and taekwondo, it wasn‚Äôt until I was nearly three years old that I discovered what truly interested me‚Äîdance. This was the beginning of my artistic journey.\nI always loved performing on stage and was often the happiest child during performances. My teachers frequently praised me as the most expressive student in class. When I was four, I began learning to draw, initially to improve my poor geometric and spatial reasoning in math. By the age of five, I was already participating in various art competitions. Although I never left a competition empty-handed, my math skills remained weak.\nAt the age of six, I joined a guzheng class with a friend. While many started, I was the only one who continued and eventually passed the highest-level exam. This perseverance was instilled in me by my mother, who always taught me the importance of ‚Äúnever giving up‚Äù once a decision had been made.\nI am deeply grateful for these experiences.\n","permalink":"https://lareinali.art/blog/young/","summary":"At the age of two, I was enrolled in a trial gymnastics class due to my poor balance.

Throughout my artistic journey, I have had the privilege of engaging in cultural exchanges that have profoundly shaped my understanding of art and its role in fostering cross-cultural dialogue.\nThe Seed of Cultural Exploration: My First Journey to the UK My journey in cultural exchange began at a young age when I was just eleven years old. During my time at The De Montfort School in the UK, I was exposed to a new culture and different artistic practices for the first time. Although I was young, this experience planted the seed for my future in cultural exchange, sparking a curiosity about how art can serve as a universal language that bridges cultural gaps. Cultural Immersion in Germany: Learning Through Exchange Building on the foundation laid during my time in the UK, I continued my journey of cultural exchange at St. Ursula Schule in Hannover, Germany. Here, I was exposed to European art management and curating practices, which contrasted sharply with the methods I was accustomed to in China. This experience broadened my perspective and deepened my appreciation for the nuances of cultural expression in different contexts, inspiring me to think more globally in my artistic practice.\nPromoting Chinese Culture on the International Stage One of the most memorable moments of my cultural exchange journey was representing Wuhan University at the Hubei UK Culture Exchange Exhibition. Welcoming Prime Minister Theresa May and demonstrating the intricate art of Han embroidery to both Chinese and British Ambassadors was a profound honor. This experience reinforced my commitment to using art as a bridge between cultures, showcasing the richness of Chinese traditions on an international platform.\nIntegrating Global Perspectives into My Art These international experiences have not only enriched my artistic practice but have also inspired me to integrate global perspectives into my work. Whether it‚Äôs through my choreography, where I merge elements of traditional Chinese dance with contemporary Western techniques, or in my role as a curator, where I strive to create exhibitions that reflect a blend of cultural influences, my goal has always been to foster understanding and appreciation across cultures through art.\nArt is more than just a creative expression; it is a means of communication that transcends borders. My journey of cultural exchange has taught me that while art may originate from a specific cultural context, its impact can be universal, resonating with audiences regardless of their background. As I continue to explore the intersections of art and culture, I remain committed to creating works that not only reflect my artistic vision but also contribute to a greater cultural dialogue.\n","permalink":"https://lareinali.art/blog/exchange/","summary":"Art has always been a powerful medium for expressing cultural identities and bridging differences.

By using personification, the dance portrays their open and covert struggles, with undercurrents of tension flowing throughout. The music, which integrates the sounds of insects and birds, further enhances this atmosphere, and as the conflicts escalate, faster drum beats are introduced to heighten the sense of urgency and confrontation. Complementing the music, the stage lighting frequently employs contrasts between warm and cool tones, effectively symbolizing the ongoing battle and opposition between the characters.
